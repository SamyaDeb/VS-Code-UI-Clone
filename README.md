# VS-Code-UI-Clone
🚀 Built a Visual Studio Code Homepage Clone...!💻

I'm excited to share that I’ve recreated the Visual Studio Code landing page using HTML and CSS as part of my front-end development learning journey! 🎉



💡 What I Used:



🔹 Tech Stack:

➤HTML5 for structure

➤CSS3 for styling and layout

➤Flexbox and Media Queries for responsiveness

➤Positioning, z-index, hover effects, and custom UI elements for polish



🔹 Features Included:

 ➥Sticky top navigation bar

 ➥ Responsive design

 ➥ Custom styled search box

 ➥ Embedded looping background video

 ➥ Interactive download buttons

 ➥ Section overlays using position: absolute

 ➥ Clean layout using Flexbox and grid-style column division



🔍 What I Learned:

 🔸 The importance of mobile responsiveness

 🔸 How to use absolute and relative positioning effectively

 🔸 Styling consistency using system fonts and variables

 🔸 Recreating UI elements pixel-by-pixel improves attention to detail and design thinking



This project not only strengthened my front-end fundamentals but also gave me real-world practice in translating modern UI/UX into clean, responsive code.
